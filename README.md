Simple Java Networking Library

This Library simplifies various elements of Java networking for the purpose of simple game servers and what not.  Currently only WebSockets have been implemented and not SSL or 
other communication protocols.   Future expansions to this library may or may not possibly include Twitch, Discord and other services.   Oh, and maybe some actual documentation.

Cheers,
